Hi there. I made this site to post about some neat reverse engineering topics I come across with my various projects.

I'm a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University in the US, and I have the pleasure of of being a small part of the #1 CTF team, [PPP](https://ctftime.org/team/284).

Right now, my projects are mostly based in low-level software exploitation, OS kernel reversing, and game engine hacking (specifically the [Source Engine](https://hackerone.com/gbps)).

I have an obsession with summoning calculators.

Hope you enjoy.
