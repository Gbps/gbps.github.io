Hi there. I made this site to post about some neat topics I come across with my various projects.

I graduated with an M.S. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019 and have been doing all sorts of projects since then. I used to play a bit for PPP, but now other projects have taken my time away from CTF.

Right now, my projects are mostly based in low-level software exploitation topics such as OS kernel reversing, PC firmware hacking, hypervisors, and game engine hacking (specifically the [Source Engine](https://hackerone.com/gbps)). No, I don't write or sell cheats, do not ask me about it.

I spend a lot of time auditing code for vulnerabilities and like to approach vulnerability research in somewhat creative ways. My goal in life is to understand how computers work from the highest of high levels to the lowest of low levels, and everything in between. I just also have an obsession with summoning calculators.

If you need to get in contact with me, I own/operate the Reverse Engineering Discord, so you can always find me there: https://discord.gg/ESGEZaVUmV

Hope you enjoy.
